            <h2>1982–1991: Detentions</h2>
            <p>After the failed 1 August 1982 coup attempt, Raila was detained without trial. Over the decade he faced repeated incarcerations tied to pro‑democracy agitation. The periods of imprisonment included a February 1988 release, an August 1988 rearrest with a June 1989 release, and a July 1990 detention alongside other reform figures. He was finally freed in June 1991 and later left for Norway in October amid security concerns.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Context:</strong> Single‑party rule and restrictions on civic space.</li>
              <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Built his profile as a democracy advocate; personal sacrifices deepened his resolve.</li>
              <li><strong>Notable moments:</strong> Advocacy for multiparty democracy continued even under house arrest and detention.</li>
