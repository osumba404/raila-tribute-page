        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <img src="imgs/images (22).jpeg" alt="Young Raila Odinga" />
        <p class="lead">Raila Amolo Odinga was born on 7 January 1945 at the Anglican Church Missionary Society Hospital in Maseno, Kisumu District (now Kisumu County), to Mary Juma Odinga and Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. Growing up in western Kenya among the Luo community, he was exposed early to public service and civic life through his father, a towering nationalist who later served as Kenya’s first Vice President.</p>

            <h2>Family & Roots</h2>
            <img src="imgs/download (66).jpeg" alt="Family and roots" />
            <p>Raila’s upbringing in Maseno and Bondo connected him to a vibrant cultural heritage that prized education, community, and public engagement. Conversations at home often revolved around Kenya’s path after independence, instilling in him a sense of duty, courage, and a belief that democracy and justice are earned through perseverance.</p>

            <h3>Childhood Schooling</h3>
            <p>He attended <strong>Kisumu Union Primary</strong> and <strong>Maranda Primary</strong> in Bondo before joining <strong>Maranda High School</strong>. Teachers described a curious and resilient student who excelled in the sciences and showed strong leadership among peers.</p>

            <h3>Formative Interests</h3>
            <p>Outside class, Raila enjoyed football and community activities, experiences that later informed his belief in teamwork and inclusivity. The mix of rural life and a politically active household gave him both humility and a national perspective.</p>

            <h2>Crossing Continents: The Germany Years (1962–1970)</h2>
            <p>In 1962, at his father’s direction, Raila transferred to East Germany. He studied the German language at the <strong>Herder Institute</strong>, University of Leipzig (1963–1965), then proceeded to <strong>Technische Hochschule Magdeburg</strong> (now Otto von Guericke University) where he completed a <strong>certificate in Welding</strong> in 1970. Living in East Germany during the Cold War exposed him to contrasting social systems and broadened his outlook on governance, social equity, and industrial development.</p>

            <article class="card">
              <p>Raila returned to Kenya in 1970 and soon founded an engineering firm (later <strong>East African Spectre</strong>) that manufactured LPG cylinders, an early sign of his interest in industrial capacity and safety standards. In 1974 he joined the <strong>Kenya Bureau of Standards</strong>, rising to Deputy Director by 1978. These roles cemented a practical appreciation of standards, governance, and the importance of institutions, principles he would carry into public life.</p>
