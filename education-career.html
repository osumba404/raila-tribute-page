        <h1>Education & Early Career</h1>
        <img src="imgs/download (68).jpeg" alt="Studies in Europe" />
        <p class="lead">From formative schooling in Kenya to rigorous technical studies in East Germany, Raila Odinga’s education shaped a disciplined, solutions‑oriented outlook that later informed his entrepreneurship and public service.</p>

            <h2>Leipzig: Language and Perspective (1963–1965)</h2>
            <p>After transferring to East Germany in 1962, Raila joined the <strong>Herder Institute</strong> at the University of Leipzig. Immersion in the German language opened access to advanced technical literature and a broader intellectual community. The classroom blended language with culture and civics, reinforcing in him a respect for systems, precision, and social cohesion.</p>

            </figure>

            <h2>Magdeburg: Technical Training (1965–1970)</h2>
            <p>Raila proceeded to <strong>Technische Hochschule Magdeburg</strong> (today part of Otto von Guericke University), completing a <strong>certificate in Welding</strong> in 1970. Coursework emphasized engineering fundamentals—materials science, fabrication, industrial safety, and quality assurance. This training fostered a lifelong focus on standards and reliability.</p>
            <p>Living in East Germany during the Cold War offered a unique vantage point on governance and economic organization. Occasional visits to West Berlin highlighted contrasts in mobility, consumer goods, and civic life—comparisons that would later inform his advocacy for equitable development and institutional reform.</p>

            <h2>Entrepreneurship: Building East African Spectre (1971–)</h2>
            <p>Returning to Kenya in 1970, Raila applied his training to the local industrial context. In 1971 he founded <strong>Standard Processing Equipment Construction & Erection Ltd</strong>—later <strong>East African Spectre</strong>—which became a pioneer in manufacturing <strong>LPG cylinders</strong>. The venture addressed a practical need: safe, locally produced cylinders to support households and businesses.</p>
            <p>Launching an engineering firm in the 1970s demanded ingenuity—sourcing equipment, ensuring safety compliance, and cultivating skilled teams. Raila’s insistence on quality aligned with the technical principles he had studied abroad, contributing to a culture of safety and reliability in an essential energy segment.</p>

            <h2>Standards and Public Service: Kenya Bureau of Standards (1974–1982)</h2>
            <p>In 1974, Raila joined the <strong>Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS)</strong> as Group Standards Manager and, in 1978, rose to <strong>Deputy Director</strong>. The role involved developing and enforcing product standards, lab testing, and market surveillance—work integral to consumer safety and industrial credibility. It deepened his belief that institutions and rules underpin sustainable development.</p>
